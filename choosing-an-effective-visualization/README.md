## Choosing an Effective Visualization

Visualization frameworks have introduced new options for illustrating data.
To choose an effective visualization you need to keep in mind the **question or business problem** you want to address with it, and the **target audience** for such visualization.

- A good visualization should establish two aspects of the data being presented:
1) Show connections within the data that are too complex to explain with words.
2) Make it easier for the audience to quickly understand the information presented and consider the outcomes from that data.

- The slides also include other tips for choosing an effective visual and improving its appearance.

All plots are created using the ggplot2 package in R
